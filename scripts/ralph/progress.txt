## US-166-1: Implement page /Rotate coordinate transformation
- Applied PageGeometry.normalize_bbox() rotation transform to chars, lines, rects, curves, images in pdf.rs
- Added rotation-aware word extraction (text direction adjustment) in page.rs
- Added RTL sort case and direction-aware gap formula in words.rs
- Added rotation-aware text extraction with join_rotated_words helper
- Added rotation-aware table cell text extraction via extract_text_for_cells_with_options
- Cross-validation: nics-background-checks-2015-11-rotated.pdf chars=100%, words=100%, lines=100%, rects=100%
- Non-rotated nics PDF remains at 100% (no regression)
- All rotation integration tests pass (29 rotation + 21 table rotation)
- cargo fmt, clippy, test --workspace all pass
- Status: COMPLETE
