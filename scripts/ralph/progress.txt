# Ralph Progress Log - Issue #168
Started: 2026-03-01

## Codebase Patterns

- **Word grouping gap calculation**: Use direction-agnostic interval distance
  `(a.x0.max(b.x0) - a.x1.min(b.x1)).max(0.0)` for ALL text directions.
  This gives 0 for overlapping/touching chars, positive for separated chars.
  Matches Python pdfplumber's signed-gap behavior for overlapping chars.
- **Cross-validation tests**: Golden data from Python pdfplumber v0.11.9.
  Always run `cargo test -p pdfplumber --test cross_validation -- --nocapture`
  to check for regressions. 56 non-ignored tests must all pass.
- **pdfplumber-py tests**: Will fail locally due to missing Python 3.11 dylib.
  Use `--exclude pdfplumber-py` for workspace tests.

## US-168-1: Improve font metrics accuracy for proportional fonts [DONE]

Root cause: Text state parameters (Tc, Tw, Tz, TL, Tf, Tr, Ts) were NOT saved/restored
by q/Q operators. Per PDF spec Table 52, these are part of the graphics state.

Fix: Added TextStateSnapshot to save/restore text state alongside graphics state in
both the main content stream q/Q handlers and handle_form_xobject.

Results:
- WARN-Report: 91.5% → >=95% ✓
- 150109DSP: 94.5% → >=70% ✓ (was already passing)
- chelsea_pdta: 93.9% → >=85% ✓ (was already passing)
- No regressions: 56 passed, 0 failed in cross-validation
- ca-warn-report.pdf, ag-energy-round-up-2017-02-24.pdf: not in fixtures

## US-168-2: Implement character deduplication [DONE]

Root cause: WordExtractor::should_split_horizontal() used `.abs()` on the x-gap
for LTR text direction. This caused overlapping chars (duplicates placed at the
same position for bold rendering) to compute a large positive gap, triggering
word splits. Python pdfplumber uses `current.x0 - last.x1` (signed, no abs),
so overlapping chars always have a negative gap that never exceeds x_tolerance.

Fix: Changed gap calculation from `.abs()` to direction-agnostic interval
distance: `(a.x0.max(b.x0) - a.x1.min(b.x1)).max(0.0)`. This was already
the formula used for RTL text. Now unified for all text directions.

Files changed:
- `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/words.rs` — should_split_horizontal() gap calc
  + 2 new tests for duplicate chars, updated text_flow test

Results:
- issue-71-duplicate-chars.pdf: words 76.8% → 95.1% (target >=90%) ✓
- issue-71-duplicate-chars-2.pdf: words 95.6% → 96.7% (target >=70%) ✓
- issue-1114-dedupe-chars.pdf: words 46.2% → 76.9% (target >=70%) ✓
- No regressions: 56 passed, 0 failed in cross-validation
- Deduplication already implemented in dedupe.rs (configurable via DedupeOptions)

Dependencies added: None

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The existing `.abs()` for LTR gap was inconsistent with Python behavior.
  RTL already used the correct interval-distance formula. Unifying them fixed
  the duplicate char issue and simplified the code.
- The PRD described this as needing dedup implementation, but the actual root
  cause was word grouping treating overlapping chars as having large gaps.
  Always investigate the actual failure mode before implementing the described
  solution.
