## Codebase Patterns
- **TableFinder debug**: Use `find_tables_debug()` to get `TableFinderDebug` with intermediate pipeline results (edges, intersections, cells, tables).
- **Golden data**: Located at `crates/pdfplumber/tests/fixtures/golden/*.json`. Use `serde::Deserialize` with matching struct fields.
- **PDF fixtures**: Located at `crates/pdfplumber/tests/fixtures/pdfs/`.
- **Edge pipeline**: Raw edges → filter (min_length) → snap → join → intersections → cells → tables.
- **Pre-existing failure**: `pdfplumber-py` tests fail locally due to missing `libpython3.11.dylib` — not a code issue.
- **Key function for US-107**: `intersections_to_cells` at table.rs:455 requires all 4 corners. The fix should use edge coverage instead.
- **Download scripts**: `scripts/download_test_fixtures.sh` (modular with separate functions per source), `scripts/download_fixtures.sh` (old, hardcoded 4 files)
- **Golden data generation**: `scripts/generate_golden.py` (currently flat, reads only top-level PDFs dir)
- **gh api** works for GitHub repos; poppler tests are on GitLab (use curl with raw URLs)

## 2026-03-01 - US-106
- Wrote diagnostic integration test: `crates/pdfplumber/tests/table_diagnostic.rs`
- Test opens nics-background-checks-2015-11.pdf and analyzes the full table detection pipeline
- Files changed: `crates/pdfplumber/tests/table_diagnostic.rs` (new), `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Dependencies added: none

### Diagnostic Findings:
- Golden: 17 rows x 25 cols = 425 cells
- Rust: 15 rows x 2 cols = 304 cells (in 1 table)
- 5 y-positions have incomplete intersection coverage:
  - y=24.0: 2/26 x-positions (outer border only — title row)
  - y=61.5: 10/26 x-positions (header row — only major section dividers)
  - y=489.9: 3/26 x-positions
  - y=561.9: 3/26 x-positions
  - y=569.3: 2/26 x-positions (outer border only — bottom)
- Root cause: `intersections_to_cells` requires all 4 corner intersection points for a cell, but horizontal edges span the full table width at these y-positions (as single long edges) while vertical edges only exist at a subset of x-positions.
- Fix approach (US-107): Check edge coverage instead of point intersections — if a horizontal edge spans [x0, x1] at a y-position and vertical edges exist at both x0 and x1 spanning [top, bottom], the cell is valid.

### Learnings:
- After snap+join, 1208 raw edges reduce to 46 processed edges (18H + 28V).
- 26 unique x-positions and 18 unique y-positions after snapping.
- The "2 cols" in Rust output is because most y-pairs only have 2 corners matching at the outer borders (x=33.1 and x=975.3).

## 2026-03-01 - US-107
- Implemented `edges_to_cells` function with two-phase grid completion in `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/table.rs`
- Phase 1: strict 4-edge coverage creates core cells, records established column boundaries
- Phase 2: grid completion — for remaining positions, if H edges span [x0, x1] at top AND bottom, AND x0/x1 are established column boundaries from Phase 1, create the cell
- Updated `find_tables()` and `find_tables_debug()` to call `edges_to_cells` instead of `intersections_to_cells`
- Exported `edges_to_cells` from core and facade crates
- Wrote 8 unit tests for `edges_to_cells` (complete grid, partial intersections, empty cases, tolerance, etc.)
- Files changed: `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/table.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber/src/lib.rs`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`

### Results:
- nics table accuracy: 6.8% → 87.5% (372/425 cells match positionally)
- Rust table dimensions: now 17 rows x 25 cols = 425 cells (matches golden exactly)
- 53 unmatched cells are text extraction differences, not structural
- All existing tests pass (0 regressions)

## 2026-03-01 - US-108
- Modified Phase 2 in `edges_to_cells` to create merged cells between V-edge boundaries instead of narrow cells at every column
- Added `normalize_table_columns` function: splits merged cells into uniform grid columns with text in first sub-cell only
- Called `normalize_table_columns` in `Page::find_tables` and `CroppedPage::find_tables` after text extraction
- Exported `normalize_table_columns` from core and facade crates
- Updated `cross_validation.rs` to assert table rate >= TABLE_THRESHOLD (0.90) for nics-background-checks
- Removed "needs investigation" comments
- Wrote 3 unit tests for `normalize_table_columns` (uniform grid, merged header, empty table)
- Files changed: `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/table.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/lib.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber/src/lib.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber/src/page.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber/src/cropped_page.rs`, `crates/pdfplumber/tests/cross_validation.rs`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`

### Results:
- nics table accuracy: 87.5% → 100% (425/425 cells match)
- All other cross-validation metrics unchanged: chars=100%, words=100%, lines=100%, rects=100%
- All existing tests pass (0 regressions)

## 2026-03-01 - US-109
- Created `scripts/download_test_fixtures.sh` — idempotent script using `gh api` to list and `curl` to download PDF fixtures from jsvine/pdfplumber (stable branch)
- Downloads 62 PDFs from `tests/pdfs/` and 19 from `from-oss-fuzz/load/` into `oss-fuzz/` subdirectory
- Skips non-PDF files (make_xref.py, issue-948.zip) via `.pdf` extension filter
- Validates non-zero file size; empty.pdf correctly rejected (0 bytes)
- Files changed: `scripts/download_test_fixtures.sh` (new), 76 new PDF fixtures
- Dependencies added: none
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `empty.pdf` in pdfplumber repo is genuinely 0 bytes — expected failure
  - Script design is modular with `download_pdfplumber_python()` function — easy to add `download_pdfjs()`, `download_pdfbox()`, `download_poppler()` for US-110/US-111
  - All 80 PDFs total on disk (4 pre-existing + 76 new)
---

## 2026-03-01 - US-110
- Added `download_pdfjs()` function to `scripts/download_test_fixtures.sh`
- Downloads 15 CJK/encoding test PDFs from mozilla/pdf.js (master branch, test/pdfs/)
- Target files: issue3521.pdf (GBKp-EUC-H Chinese), noembed-eucjp/sjis/jis7/identity/identity-2.pdf (Japanese encodings), vertical.pdf (CJK vertical writing), issue8570.pdf (Japanese), ArabicCIDTrueType.pdf, cid_cff.pdf, text_clip_cff_cid.pdf, issue7696.pdf, issue4875.pdf, issue14117.pdf, issue9262_reduced.pdf (5.3MB)
- All 15 files placed in `crates/pdfplumber/tests/fixtures/pdfs/pdfjs/`
- All files have valid %PDF- header and non-zero size
- Script is idempotent (re-run skips existing files)
- Files changed: `scripts/download_test_fixtures.sh` (updated), 15 new PDF fixtures, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Dependencies added: none
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - pdf.js test PDFs exist directly in `test/pdfs/` (not as .link files) for the selected files
  - Download URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mozilla/pdf.js/master/test/pdfs/<filename>`
  - issue9262_reduced.pdf is 5.3MB — largest fixture file
  - 95 total PDFs on disk after this story
