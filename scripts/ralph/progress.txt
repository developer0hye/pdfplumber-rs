## Codebase Patterns
- `try_fix_startxref()` pattern: when lopdf fails to parse, attempt recovery by scanning for the actual xref offset and patching the bytes before retrying. This is a general pattern for handling malformed PDFs.
- Cross-validation tests: use `cross_validate!` macro for PDFs that parse successfully, `cross_validate_ignored!` for known failures. When fixing a parse error, update from ignored to passing.
- Backend unit tests for issue-specific PDFs: check fixture existence with `if !pdf_path.exists()` and skip gracefully to avoid CI failures when fixtures are missing.
