## Codebase Patterns
- Workspace uses `edition.workspace = true` and `rust-version.workspace = true` to inherit from root
- Crate directory structure: `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml` + `crates/<name>/src/lib.rs`
- Dependency chain: pdfplumber → {pdfplumber-core, pdfplumber-parse}, pdfplumber-parse → pdfplumber-core
- pdfplumber-core has zero external dependencies (pure algorithms)
- Quality checks: `cargo fmt --all -- --check && cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace && cargo check --workspace`

## 2026-02-27 - US-018: WordExtractor - tolerance-based character grouping
- **What was implemented:**
  - `BBox` type in `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/geometry.rs` — bounding box with top-left origin (x0, top, x1, bottom), with union/width/height methods
  - `Char` type in `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/text.rs` — character with text, bbox, fontname, size
  - `WordOptions` struct with pdfplumber-compatible defaults (x_tolerance=3, y_tolerance=3, keep_blank_chars=false, use_text_flow=false)
  - `Word` struct with text, bbox (union of char bboxes), and constituent chars
  - `WordExtractor::extract()` — groups chars into words by spatial proximity with sorting, space handling, and tolerance-based grouping
- **Files changed:**
  - `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/lib.rs` — module declarations and re-exports
  - `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/geometry.rs` (new) — BBox type
  - `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/text.rs` (new) — Char type
  - `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/words.rs` (new) — Word, WordOptions, WordExtractor + 21 unit tests
- **Dependencies added:** None (pure Rust, zero dependencies)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Keep modules flat (geometry.rs, text.rs, words.rs) rather than nested — simpler and matches crate convention
  - `BBox::union()` is the key primitive for composing bounding boxes — will be reused across many features
  - Word extraction gap check: `x_gap = next.x0 - prev.x1`, new word if `> x_tolerance` or `y_diff > y_tolerance`
  - Sorting by (top, x0) before grouping handles out-of-order chars from PDF content streams
