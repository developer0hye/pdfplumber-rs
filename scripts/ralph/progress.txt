## Codebase Patterns
- Color is an enum (Gray/Rgb/Cmyk/Other with f32 values), not a struct. Use `.clone()` since it doesn't implement Copy (due to Other(Vec<f32>)).
- Orientation enum lives in geometry.rs. LineOrientation in shapes.rs is a type alias for Orientation.
- All coordinates use f64. Color values use f32.
- BBox uses top-left origin: (x0, top, x1, bottom).

## 2026-02-28 - US-002
- What was implemented: Core data model types - Color enum (Gray/Rgb/Cmyk/Other), Orientation enum, zero-size BBox edge case test
- Files changed:
  - crates/pdfplumber-core/src/geometry.rs (added Orientation enum, zero-size BBox test)
  - crates/pdfplumber-core/src/painting.rs (Color struct -> enum with Gray/Rgb/Cmyk/Other variants)
  - crates/pdfplumber-core/src/shapes.rs (LineOrientation -> type alias for Orientation, clone Color)
  - crates/pdfplumber-core/src/edges.rs (use Orientation from geometry)
  - crates/pdfplumber-core/src/lib.rs (export Orientation)
  - crates/pdfplumber/src/lib.rs (re-export Orientation)
- Dependencies added: none
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BBox, TextDirection, LineOrientation already existed in the codebase from Phase 2 work
  - Color was a simple RGB struct - changed to proper PDF color space enum
  - Color can't derive Copy due to Other(Vec<f32>) - need .clone() everywhere it was previously copied
  - Kept LineOrientation as type alias to avoid breaking existing code in pdfplumber crate
