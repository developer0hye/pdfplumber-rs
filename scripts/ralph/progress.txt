## Codebase Patterns
- **TableFinder debug**: Use `find_tables_debug()` to get `TableFinderDebug` with intermediate pipeline results (edges, intersections, cells, tables).
- **Golden data**: Located at `crates/pdfplumber/tests/fixtures/golden/*.json`. Use `serde::Deserialize` with matching struct fields.
- **PDF fixtures**: Located at `crates/pdfplumber/tests/fixtures/pdfs/`.
- **Edge pipeline**: Raw edges → filter (min_length) → snap → join → intersections → cells → tables.
- **Pre-existing failure**: `pdfplumber-py` tests fail locally due to missing `libpython3.11.dylib` — not a code issue.
- **Key function for US-107**: `intersections_to_cells` at table.rs:455 requires all 4 corners. The fix should use edge coverage instead.

## 2026-03-01 - US-106
- Wrote diagnostic integration test: `crates/pdfplumber/tests/table_diagnostic.rs`
- Test opens nics-background-checks-2015-11.pdf and analyzes the full table detection pipeline
- Files changed: `crates/pdfplumber/tests/table_diagnostic.rs` (new), `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- Dependencies added: none

### Diagnostic Findings:
- Golden: 17 rows x 25 cols = 425 cells
- Rust: 15 rows x 2 cols = 304 cells (in 1 table)
- 5 y-positions have incomplete intersection coverage:
  - y=24.0: 2/26 x-positions (outer border only — title row)
  - y=61.5: 10/26 x-positions (header row — only major section dividers)
  - y=489.9: 3/26 x-positions
  - y=561.9: 3/26 x-positions
  - y=569.3: 2/26 x-positions (outer border only — bottom)
- Root cause: `intersections_to_cells` requires all 4 corner intersection points for a cell, but horizontal edges span the full table width at these y-positions (as single long edges) while vertical edges only exist at a subset of x-positions.
- Fix approach (US-107): Check edge coverage instead of point intersections — if a horizontal edge spans [x0, x1] at a y-position and vertical edges exist at both x0 and x1 spanning [top, bottom], the cell is valid.

### Learnings:
- After snap+join, 1208 raw edges reduce to 46 processed edges (18H + 28V).
- 26 unique x-positions and 18 unique y-positions after snapping.
- The "2 cols" in Rust output is because most y-pairs only have 2 corners matching at the outer borders (x=33.1 and x=975.3).
