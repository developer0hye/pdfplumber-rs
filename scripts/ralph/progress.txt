## 2026-03-01 - US-155-1, US-155-2, US-155-3
- Deleted `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/markdown.rs` (1,065 lines removed)
- Removed `pub mod markdown;` and `pub use markdown::{MarkdownOptions, MarkdownRenderer};` from `crates/pdfplumber-core/src/lib.rs`
- Removed `MarkdownOptions` and `MarkdownRenderer` from re-exports in `crates/pdfplumber/src/lib.rs`
- Removed `MarkdownOptions`/`MarkdownRenderer` imports and `Page::to_markdown()` method from `crates/pdfplumber/src/page.rs`
- Removed `Markdown` variant from `TextFormat` enum in `crates/pdfplumber-cli/src/cli.rs`
- Removed `TextFormat::Markdown` match arm and `MarkdownOptions` import from `crates/pdfplumber-cli/src/text_cmd.rs`
- Removed `TextFormat::Markdown` from pattern matches in `crates/pdfplumber-cli/src/bookmarks_cmd.rs` and `crates/pdfplumber-cli/src/info_cmd.rs`
- No markdown references remain in the codebase (verified with grep)
- All quality checks pass: fmt, clippy, check, test (pdfplumber-py excluded due to pre-existing libpython3.11 env issue)
- Files changed: 8 files modified, 1 file deleted
- Dependencies added: none
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Deletion tasks across layered crates (core → facade → cli) are straightforward — work bottom-up
  - cropped_page.rs had no markdown references despite being mentioned in PRD notes
  - pdfplumber-py tests fail due to missing libpython3.11.dylib — pre-existing env issue, not related to changes
