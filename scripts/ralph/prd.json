      "description": "Several PDFs score below 95% due to font metrics gaps causing cumulative x-drift: 150109DSP-Milw-505-90D.pdf (66.6%), ag-energy-round-up-2017-02-24.pdf (83.6%), ca-warn-report.pdf (91.5%), chelsea_pdta.pdf (84.3%). The root cause is that char widths derived from content streams don't match the actual glyph widths for proportional fonts when /Widths arrays are present but not fully utilized, or when font metrics resolution is incomplete. Investigate the font metrics pipeline and improve width resolution to reduce x-drift.",

Python pdfplumber uses a signed gap (no abs), so overlapping chars always group together. Fix: changed gap calculation to direction-agnostic interval distance (same formula already used for RTL). Results: issue-71-duplicate-chars.pdf words 76.8%→95.1%, issue-71-duplicate-chars-2.pdf words 95.6%→96.7%, issue-1114-dedupe-chars.pdf words 46.2%→76.9%.
